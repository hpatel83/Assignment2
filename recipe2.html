    <ol>
      <li>Whisk the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and lemon zest together in a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Toss the wings in the spice blend, using your hands to make sure each wing is thoroughly and evenly coated.</li>
      <li>Place on a large rimmed baking sheet or in a large casserole dish in a single layer. The wings can be snug and touching each other. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or for up to 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat to 325°F. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or foil.</li>
      <li>Divide the chicken wings between the baking sheets, spacing them evenly and in a single layer. Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Increase the heat to 450°F and roast for 15 minutes. Flip the wings and roast until the skin is very crispy and brown on both sides, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
